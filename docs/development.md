# Development Guide

Welcome to Roost. This guide covers everything you need to set up your development environment, understand the codebase structure, and contribute to the project.

## Prerequisites

### Rust toolchain

- **Rust stable** with `rustfmt` and `clippy`, from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs):
  `rustup component add rustfmt clippy`. CI builds with the current stable
  toolchain. No crate declares a `rust-version` (MSRV); all crates use
  edition 2021, and some dependencies need a recent stable compiler.
- **Git**.

### System packages

The list below is what the CI `check` job installs on Ubuntu 24.04
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); it is enough to build, lint and test the
whole workspace:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libseat-dev libinput-dev libudev-dev libgbm-dev libdrm-dev \
  libxkbcommon-dev pkg-config libgtk-4-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev \
  libadwaita-1-dev libpam-wrapper \
  meson ninja-build libwayland-dev wayland-protocols
scripts/ci-install-gtk4-layer-shell
```

Ubuntu does not package gtk4-layer-shell, which the GTK shell links;
`scripts/ci-install-gtk4-layer-shell` builds it from source and installs it
under `/usr/local`. The `pipewire` crate also needs libclang (`libclang-dev`)
at build time; GitHub's runners have it preinstalled. `libpam-wrapper` is
only needed for the lock-screen PAM test, which skips without it.

To run a nested session, also install the libraries the nested backend
loads at startup and, on a machine without a display, Xvfb:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y libxkbcommon-x11-dev libegl1 libgl1-mesa-dri libgbm1 xvfb
```

Each proof script needs a few more packages; [running tests locally](testing.md)
lists them per script.

On Arch Linux (TunaOS Marlin's base), the `arch-package` CI job builds with:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git rust pkgconf clang pipewire gtk4 \
  gtk4-layer-shell libadwaita libxkbcommon libxkbcommon-x11 mesa wayland \
  dbus glib2 seatd libinput systemd-libs libdrm
```

### Spektacular CLI (planning work only)

Building, testing and running Roost do not need Spektacular. You need it
only to read or change specs and plans, which are managed through the
[Spektacular](https://github.com/hivecommons/spektacular) CLI rather than by
editing `.spektacular/` by hand. It is a Go program; with a Go toolchain
installed:

```sh
go install github.com/hivecommons/spektacular@latest
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
spektacular version check
```

## Project Structure

The project is a Cargo workspace with six crates. Each crate's `README.md`
lists its purpose, public API, and dependents.

```

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hanthor/roost-desktop.git
   cd roost-desktop
   ```

2. **Build all crates:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --workspace
   ```

3. **Run the tests** (see [running tests locally](testing.md) for clippy,
   fmt and the nested proofs CI runs):
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   ```

## Running the Nested Compositor

The nested compositor runs inside your current Wayland or X11 session for safe development and testing. It creates a Roost session as a client of your host display.

### First-time setup

```bash
# Build and start a nested Roost session
./scripts/roost-nested run
```

This command:
- Builds `roost-compositor` and `roost-shell-host` (debug build)
- Starts the compositor on a private socket (named `roost-nested-<pid>` by default)
- Logs output to `~/.local/state/roost-nested/roost-nested-<pid>/nested.log`
- Displays the socket name and log path for reference

The session runs until you press Ctrl+C or terminate the process.

### Testing shell crashes and recovery

Roost implements a supervised shell-host restart mechanism. Test it with:

```bash
# In one terminal, start the nested session:
./scripts/roost-nested run

# In another terminal, simulate a shell crash:
./scripts/roost-nested kill-shell --socket roost-nested-<pid>
```

The compositor will:
1. Detect the shell-host crash
2. Display a recovery overlay
3. Restart the shell-host automatically within a bounded restart budget
4. Keep all application connections alive during the restart

See `docs/nested-session.md` for details on the crash recovery design.

## Understanding Spektacular Workflows

Roost uses Spektacular for planning and tracking implementation work. Each work item has:

- **Spec**: A specification document (in `.spektacular/specs/`)
- **Plan**: Implementation roadmap and checklist (in `.spektacular/plans/`)
- **Context**: Mutable tracking state and work artifacts

### Common Spektacular commands

```bash
# List specs (use the full timestamp-prefixed name in later commands)
spektacular spec file list

# Start the plan workflow for a spec
spektacular plan new --data '{"name":"<full spec name>"}'
```

Run `spektacular <command> --help` for the rest. For more details, see the [Spektacular repository](https://github.com/hivecommons/spektacular) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Architecture and Design

For deeper understanding of Roost's design:

- **Architecture overview**: Read `docs/architecture.md` for the compositor/shell separation, nested recovery design, and long-term roadmap
- **Design decisions**: Check `docs/adr/` (Architecture Decision Records) for rationale on key choices (e.g., Smithay pinning, backend selection)
- **Verification strategy**: See `docs/test-strategy.md` for how we validate each layer (unit tests, protocol probes, integration tests, hardware qualification)
- **Test strategy and matrix**: Roost targets multiple environments, GPU configurations, and client types; the test strategy document details the coverage plan

## Workflow for contributors

1. **Choose a spec**: Find an open spec in `.spektacular/specs/` or create one
2. **Review the plan**: Check the associated plan in `.spektacular/plans/` for implementation guidance
3. **Implement**: Edit crates as needed, using the test strategy guide to add tests
4. **Test locally**: Follow [running tests locally](testing.md) and use `./scripts/roost-nested run` to validate
5. **Create a PR**: Reference the spec number and plan state in your PR body
6. **Update spec/plan state**: Once merged, update the spec and plan in Spektacular to reflect completion

## Common tasks

### Adding a new protocol feature
1. Define the protocol in `crates/shell-control-schema/`
2. Implement compositor side in `crates/compositor/`
3. Implement shell-host side in `crates/shell-host/`
4. Add a protocol probe in `.spektacular/work/` if appropriate
5. Document the change in `docs/adr/` if it's a significant choice

### Writing a test
- Unit tests: Add inline tests in the crate (follow `#[cfg(test)]` patterns)
- Protocol probes: Add scripts under `scripts/`
- Nested integration: Use `./scripts/roost-journey` as a base or add a new harness

**Timing rule (#72).** Never gate a test on a fixed iteration budget or a
sleep length: a loaded CI runner exhausts both. Wait on a wall-clock
deadline that is generous (seconds, not milliseconds) and only makes a
slow run slower, or make the ordering deterministic (a latch the test
releases, a manual clock, a counter of finished workers). Assert on
state, never on elapsed time, except for explicit no-hang bounds. There
is no retry policy for deterministic tests: `gh run rerun --failed` is a
diagnostic, not a fix.

### Debugging
- Compositor logs: Check the output of `./scripts/roost-nested run` or tail the log file; [nested session troubleshooting](nested-session.md#troubleshooting) explains the common lines
- Shell-host logs: Printed to the same log file as the compositor
- Nested shell interaction: Use `./scripts/roost-nested shell-pid` to identify the shell process for attaching a debugger

## Reporting issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request:

1. Check existing issues in the repository
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Environment (distro, GPU, Rust version, Roost commit); for nested-session bugs, see [filing a bug](nested-session.md#filing-a-bug)
3. Reference relevant specs in `.spektacular/specs/` if applicable
